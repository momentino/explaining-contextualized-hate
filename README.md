# Explaining Hate Speech in Context using LIME and SHAP
The goal of this project was that of explaining a RoBERTa Hate Speech classifier fine-tuned with contextual information (the previous post) and compare the extracted rationales with those obtained by the same architecture fine-tuned only on the target posts (no context was provided to the model in this case).
